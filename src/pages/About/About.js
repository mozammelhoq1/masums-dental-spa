            I'm a Front End Developer based in Bangladesh. I describe myself as
            a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web
            platform. I like to create projects. That helps me to learn and grow
            as a developer. Also I enjoy making technical things at my college
            lab. In my free time you can find me tourist place ,at field , at
            the road on cycling around Chittagong bangladesh. My future thinking
            is that I will be a full fledged web developer, this is my
            profession, passion and dream. I spend 8 to 12 hours a day trying to
            reach my goals. And I am thinking of building a career in this field
            in the future. Thank You ‚ù§Ô∏è
